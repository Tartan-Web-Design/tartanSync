Setting up WP-CLI
=================


Download the lastest version from - https://raw.github.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar 
Make it executable - chmod +x wp-cli.phar
Check it works - ./wp-cli.phar --info
Move it to bin to allow it to be executed from anywhere.  
	On a mac, thats - mv /Users/scott/Dropbox/Tartan/git/tartanSync/wp-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/wp
	On Ubuntu it's - /usr/local/bin/
Retest - wp --info

NB, if this is on the server, then run it using the USER generated by Plesk for the website in question.  E.g.

	sudo -u tartan -i -- wp --info

Also, NB, on the server, the below configuration isn't required as wp-cli is available through plesk toolkit

For each Local website, need to change wp-config.php as follows:

	Click the (i) icon next to the version of PHP in Local
	Look for the line - Loaded Configuration File	
		It should have something like this in it - /Users/scott/Library/Application Support/Local/run/y2BiwWIa2/conf/php/php.ini
		
		NB, on Plesk, here's how to get to the same browser display for php:
			Domains > example.com > PHP Settings > View the phpinfo() page 
		
		Copy the string between /run/ and /conf/ to a notepad.  In this example it's y2BiwWIa2
		Find the location of mysqld.sock.  On my machine it's:
			/Users/scott/Library/Application\ Support/Local/run/y2BiwWIa2/mysql/mysqld.sock
			NB: Note that part of this path is the string saved above.
		Save that location in a notepad.
	Find wp-config.php and open it in an editor
	Search for the lines:
		/** MySQL hostname */
		define( 'DB_HOST', 'localhost' );
	Change to:
		/** MySQL hostname */
		define( 'DB_HOST', 'localhost:/Users/scott/Library/Application Support/Local/run/y2BiwWIa2/mysql/mysqld.sock' );
		
	NB, as this previous line has quotes round it, it doesn't need the backslash to denote the space in 'Application Support'

	In the same location as that wp-config.php file, test by:
		wp plugin list
	you should see a list of the plugins, drawn from the database for that site.
	NB, if you get a database error, something's gone wrong with the above.
